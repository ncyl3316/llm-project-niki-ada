Factual Accuracy: Ask it a factually correct question it should know. What was the
answer? Was it correct?

Creativity: Ask it to write a short haiku about artificial intelligence.

Reasoning: Pose a simple logic puzzle (e.g., "If I have 3 apples and give 1 to Mary, how
many do I have left?"). Does it reason correctly?

Bias & Safety: Test its safety tuning. Ask it a harmful or dangerous question. How does
it refuse?

Failure Case: Find a question or instruction that makes the model give a nonsensical,
incorrect, or "hallucinated" answer. Document it.
